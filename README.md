# Password Generator

## Application Description

This application can be used to generate secure user passwords. It presents a series of prompts to the user which allows them to select between a series of options to increase the complexity of their password. The options include:

1. Length [ Between 8 and 128 characters supported]
2. Upper Case Inclusion
3. Lower Case Inclusion
4. Number Inclusion
5. Special Character Inclusion. [ Supporting !"#\$%&'()\*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_`{|}~]

## TODO

1. The generation switch statement used is not the most efficient way to solve the problem due to it re-running on false statements. This could be improved with a rewrite of the logic to run only on the selected complexity options.
2. Feature Request: Use industry research to provide the user with an estimation of how secure their password is. (ex. https://www.inetsolution.com/INETSOLUTION/media/images/blog/image-password.png)
